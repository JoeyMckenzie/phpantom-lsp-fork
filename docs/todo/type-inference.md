# PHPantom — Type Inference & Resolution

This document covers type resolution gaps: generic resolution, conditional
return types, type narrowing, PHP version features, and stub attribute
handling. Items that are purely about *completion UX* or *stub metadata
extraction* live in [todo-completion.md](todo-completion.md).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

| Label | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low** |
| **Effort** | **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

## 3. Parse and resolve `($param is T ? A : B)` return types
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's stubs use conditional return type syntax in docblocks:

```php
/**
 * @return ($value is string ? true : false)
 */
function is_string(mixed $value): bool {}
```

This is the mechanism behind all `is_*` function type narrowing in
PHPStan — the stubs declare the conditional, and the type specifier
reads it.  If we parse this syntax from stubs and `@return` tags, we
get type narrowing for `is_string`, `is_int`, `is_array`,
`is_object`, `is_null`, `is_bool`, `is_float`, `is_numeric`,
`is_scalar`, `is_callable`, `is_iterable`, `is_countable`, and
`is_resource` from annotations alone, without any hard-coded function
list.

The syntax also appears in userland code (PHPStan and Psalm both
support it), and in array function stubs:

```php
/**
 * @return ($array is non-empty-array ? non-empty-list<T> : list<T>)
 */
function array_values(array $array): array {}
```

**Implementation:** Extend the return type parser in
`docblock/types.rs` to recognise the `($paramName is Type ? A : B)`
pattern.  At call sites, check the argument's type against the
condition and select the appropriate branch.  This could reuse or
extend the existing `ConditionalReturnType` infrastructure.

## 4. Inherited docblock type propagation
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

When a child class overrides a method from a parent class or interface,
the ancestor's richer docblock types should flow down unconditionally.
Inheritance is the default — if the ancestor says `@return list<Pen>`
and the child just says `: array`, the resolved return type must be
`list<Pen>`. There is no opt-in; `@inheritDoc` is functionally
meaningless because a child that can run code already has the parent's
contract. The only thing that *blocks* inheritance is the child
providing its own docblock type that is equally or more specific.

**Example:**

```php
interface PenHolder {
    /** @return list<Pen> */
    public function getPens(): array;
}

class Drawer implements PenHolder {
    // No docblock — native return type is just `array`.
    public function getPens(): array { return []; }
}

$d = new Drawer();
$d->getPens()[0]-> // ← should complete Pen members
```

Today `Drawer::getPens()` resolves to `return_type: "array"` because
the method's own docblock has no `@return` tag and the native hint is
`array`. The interface's `@return list<Pen>` is never consulted.

**Root cause:** `resolve_class_with_inheritance` (inheritance.rs L155)
and `resolve_class_fully_inner` (virtual_members/mod.rs L360) both
skip a parent/interface method when the child already declares one
with the same name — the child wins unconditionally. No fallback
check compares the richness of the return type.

**What needs to change:**

1. **During inheritance merging** (`resolve_class_with_inheritance`):
   when the child already has a method with the same name, don't
   just skip — enrich it. If the child's `return_type` equals its
   `native_return_type` (i.e. no docblock refined it) and the
   ancestor's `return_type` differs from its `native_return_type`
   (i.e. the ancestor *does* have a richer docblock type), copy the
   ancestor's `return_type` onto the child's method. Do the same
   for each parameter's `type_hint` when the child's matches its
   `native_type_hint`. Also inherit `description` and
   `return_description` when the child lacks them.

2. **During interface merging** (`resolve_class_fully_inner`): same
   logic — when an interface method is skipped because the class
   already defines it, enrich the existing method with the
   interface's richer types and descriptions.

3. **Child docblock wins when present.** If the child provides its
   own `@return` or `@param` type (even if less specific), that is
   an intentional override and the ancestor type is not propagated.
   The test is simple: does the child's effective type differ from
   its native type? If yes, the child wrote a docblock — respect it.

**Scope of the fix:** This affects completion (return type drives
chain resolution), hover (return type displayed), and signature help
(parameter types shown). All three automatically benefit once the
merged `MethodInfo` carries the richer type.

**Properties too:** The same pattern applies to properties. An
interface declaring `@property-read list<Pen> $pens` should
propagate to an implementing class's `$pens` property if the class
only has a native `array` type hint.

## 5. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

## 6. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

---

## 8. SPL iterator generic stubs
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's `iterable.stub` provides full `@template TKey` /
`@template TValue` annotations for the entire SPL iterator hierarchy:
`ArrayIterator`, `FilterIterator`, `LimitIterator`,
`CachingIterator`, `RegexIterator`, `NoRewindIterator`,
`InfiniteIterator`, `AppendIterator`, `IteratorIterator`,
`RecursiveIteratorIterator`, `CallbackFilterIterator`, and more.

This means `foreach` over any SPL iterator properly resolves element
types.  If we rely on php-stubs for these classes, we are almost
certainly missing these generic annotations.  We should either:

- Ship our own stub overlays for the SPL iterator classes with
  `@template` annotations (like PHPStan does), or
- Detect and use PHPStan's stubs when present in the project's
  vendor directory.

---

## 9. Asymmetric visibility (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Separate from property hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on
plain and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static
properties as well.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

**Fix:** Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

## 10. `str_contains` / `str_starts_with` / `str_ends_with` → non-empty-string narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

When `str_contains($haystack, $needle)` appears in a condition and
`$needle` is known to be a non-empty string, PHPStan narrows
`$haystack` to `non-empty-string`.  The same applies to
`str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`, `stripos`,
`strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.

This is lower priority for an LSP because `non-empty-string` does
not directly enable class-based completion, but it would improve
hover type display and catch bugs if we ever add diagnostics.

See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 11. `count` / `sizeof` comparison → non-empty-array narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`if (count($arr) > 0)` or `if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to
a non-empty-array.  PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison
operators and integer range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls.

See `CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension` and the count-related
branches in `TypeSpecifier::specifyTypesInCondition`.

---

## 12. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

## 13. Non-empty-string propagation through string functions
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` through string-manipulating
functions.  If you pass a `non-empty-string` to `addslashes()`,
`urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`, `escapeshellarg()`,
`escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`, `rawurlencode()`, or
`rawurldecode()`, the return type is also `non-empty-string`.

This is low priority for an LSP because the narrower string type
does not directly enable class-based completion.  However, if we
ever add hover type display or diagnostics, this information
would improve accuracy.

See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 14. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables holding closure literals, arrow functions, and first-class
callables now resolve to the `Closure` class, so `$fn->bindTo()`,
`$fn->call()`, etc. offer completions.  The remaining gap is
*preserving the closure's callable signature* through `Closure::bind()`
and resolving `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a typed `Closure`.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 15. `@param-closure-this`
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

The `@param-closure-this` PHPDoc tag declares what `$this` refers to
inside a closure parameter. This is critical for frameworks like Laravel
where closures are commonly rebound via `Closure::bindTo()`:

```php
/**
 * @param-closure-this \Illuminate\Routing\Route $callback
 */
function group(Closure $callback): void;
```

Without this, `$this->` inside the closure body produces no completions.
Laravel's routing (`Route::group`), testing (`$this->get(...)` inside
test closures), and macro APIs all rely on closure rebinding.

**Implementation:**

1. **Docblock parsing** — recognise `@param-closure-this` in
   `docblock/tags.rs`. The tag format is
   `@param-closure-this TypeName $paramName`. Extract the type string
   and the parameter name it applies to.

2. **Store on `ParameterInfo`** — add an optional `closure_this_type:
   Option<String>` field to `ParameterInfo`. During function/method
   extraction, if the docblock contains `@param-closure-this` for a
   parameter, populate this field.

3. **Closure `$this` resolution** — when resolving `$this` inside a
   closure body, check whether the closure is passed as an argument to
   a function/method call. If so, resolve the receiving function,
   find the target parameter, and check for `closure_this_type`. If
   present, use that type instead of the lexical `$this` class.

4. **Interaction with `Closure::bind()`** — this tag is the static
   analysis equivalent of runtime `Closure::bindTo()`. The two
   features are complementary: `@param-closure-this` handles the
   common case where the rebinding happens inside the called function,
   while `Closure::bind()` support (§14) handles explicit user-side
   rebinding.

## 16. `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom already parses `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` as type keywords
but does not resolve them to concrete types. When `T` is bound to a
concrete array type, these utility types should resolve:

- `value-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `string|int`
- `key-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `'a'|'b'`
- `value-of<array<string, User>>` → `User`
- `key-of<array<string, User>>` → `string`

These types commonly appear in PHPStan-typed libraries and in
`@template` constraints. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of array
 * @param T $array
 * @return value-of<T>
 */
function first(array $array): mixed;
```

**Implementation:** plug into the generic substitution pipeline in
`inheritance.rs` / `completion/types/resolution.rs`. After template
parameters are substituted with concrete types, detect `key-of<...>`
and `value-of<...>` wrappers and resolve them by inspecting the inner
type:

- If the inner type is an `array{...}` shape, collect the key or value
  types from the shape fields.
- If the inner type is `array<K, V>`, extract `K` or `V` directly.
- If the inner type is still an unresolved template parameter, leave
  it as-is (it may resolve later in the chain).

## 28. `__invoke()` return type resolution
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Calling an object as a function (`$obj()`) does not resolve the return
type from the object's `__invoke()` method. The call expression path
does not check for `__invoke` when the callee is a variable holding
an object type.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (call_expression/invoke_return_type).
